# JavaScript Exercises

These JavaScript exercises are from the The Odin Project's [Web Development 101 Online Course](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/fundamentals-part-4). 

## Instructions and Goals

Each exercise includes 3 files: a markdown file with a description of the task, an empty (or mostly empty) javascript file, and a set of tests. 

To complete the exercise, I will be accessing the exercise directory in a terminal and run jasmine filename.spec.js. This should find and run the test file and show me the output. Upon first running the tests I will find that the tests fail: this is by design! My task is to open up the javascript file and write the code needed to get all of the tests to pass. 

Some of the exercises have test conditions defined in the spec file that are defined as 'xit' compared to 'it'. This is purposeful, and as I test my solution against the first 'it', on success I will change the next 'xit' to an 'it' and test my code again, until all conditions are satisfied.
